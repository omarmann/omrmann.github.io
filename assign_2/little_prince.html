As the little prince dropped off to sleep, 
I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.

<u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. 
</u>

<span style="background-color: orange;">
It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. 
</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his plae forehead, his closed 
eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myslef:
<b>
<span style="color: red",  >
"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
</span>
</b>

As his lips open slightlt with the suspicion of a half-smile, 
I said to myself, again:

<b>
<span style="color: red",  >
"What moves me so deeply, about this price who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through 
his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . "
</span>
</b>

And I felt him to be fragile still.

<u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
might be extinguished by a little of wind...
</u>
